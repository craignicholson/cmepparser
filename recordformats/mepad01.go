  Meter string // Arbitrary Text, Time Interval ("MMDDHHMM"), Protocol Text triplet: Each data entry is a set of three fields. The number of meter entry sets is described in the "Meter Count" field above. The "Arbitrary Text" entry is the Meter ID. This is the placard identifier or faceplate serial number to physically identify a meter. This is usually some arbitrary combination of letters and numbers that make up a meter manufacturer's serial number. It may, however, be some other easily found identifying label on the metering equipment. This field may optionally be used as a channel identifier for situations where that information is useful. Currently, only the first 12 characters of this entry will be recognized by PG&E. The "Time Interval" entry is the Usage reading interval, the time interval that meter data is supplied. For example, monthly read meters would be encoded as "01000000", weekly as "00070000, hourly as "00000100", and 30 minute as "00000030". Note: "KWHREG", "KVAHREG", KVARHREG", and "GASREG" readings are special cases and are always assumed to be available in monthly intervals only for inclusion on printed bills. The "Protocol Text:" contains the Units parameters. This is a list of metering units supplied for this account. When multiple data types are available, individual abbreviations are separated by ASCII Space characters (20 Hexadecimal). For example, Meter reading plus kilowatt hours is "KWHREG KWH"; meter reading, kilowatt hours, and kilovar hours is "KWHREG KWH KVARH". A complete list of abbreviations is supplied in the Protocol Text Units listing. A maximum of 8 unit parameter entries per field is allowed. The length of this text shall not exceed 64 characters.
